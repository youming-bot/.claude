# Quality Gates and Feedback Loops

## Quality Gate Framework

### Gate Levels
1. **Blocker**: Prevents progression to next agent
2. **Warning**: Allows progression with documented risks
3. **Info**: Noted for future improvement

### Quality Metrics Per Agent

#### Product Agent
- **Blocker**: No clear requirement definition
- **Warning**: Ambiguous acceptance criteria
- **Info**: Missing edge cases

#### Architect Agent
- **Blocker**: No clear technical decisions
- **Warning**: Missing reversibility assessments
- **Info**: Alternative approaches not considered

#### Coder Agent
- **Blocker**: Code doesn't compile or tests fail
- **Warning**: Test coverage < 90%
- **Info**: Code complexity > threshold

#### Reviewer Agent
- **Blocker**: Critical architecture violations
- **Warning**: Code quality issues
- **Info**: Style improvements

#### Tester Agent
- **Blocker**: No tests for critical paths
- **Warning**: Performance targets not met
- **Info**: Edge cases not covered

#### Deployer Agent
- **Blocker**: Deployment configuration invalid
- **Warning**: Security concerns
- **Info**: Optimization opportunities

#### Writer Agent
- **Blocker**: Documentation doesn't work
- **Warning**: Missing critical information
- **Info**: Could be more comprehensive

## Fast Feedback Loops

### Immediate Feedback (Minutes)
- **Reviewer → Coder**: Code quality issues
- **Tester → Coder**: Test failures
- **Deployer → Coder**: Deployment blockers

### Short Feedback (Hours)
- **Product → Architect**: Requirement clarifications
- **Architect → Coder**: Design questions
- **Writer → All**: Documentation gaps

### Long Feedback (Days)
- **Writer → Product**: User experience improvements
- **Deployer → Architect**: Scaling concerns
- **All → Product**: Feature refinement

## Feedback Loop Implementation

### 1. Real-time Notifications
```bash
# Reviewer Agent immediate feedback to Coder
if [ "$critical_issues_found" = true ]; then
  echo "CRITICAL: Immediate feedback sent to Coder Agent"
  touch "output/feedback/coder_immediate.review"
fi
```

### 2. Scheduled Feedback
```bash
# Daily quality summary
generate_quality_report() {
  # Collect metrics from all agents
  # Generate comprehensive quality score
  # Identify trends and improvements
}
```

### 3. Gate Enforcement
```bash
# Quality gate before progression
check_quality_gate() {
  local agent=$1
  local gate_level=$2

  if [ "$gate_level" = "blocker" ]; then
    echo "BLOCKER: $agent cannot proceed"
    return 1
  fi

  if [ "$gate_level" = "warning" ]; then
    echo "WARNING: $agent proceeding with documented risks"
    log_risk "$agent" "$risk_details"
  fi

  return 0
}
```

## Quality Score Calculation

### Scoring Formula
```
Overall Quality Score = (Product_Score * 0.15) +
                       (Architect_Score * 0.20) +
                       (Coder_Score * 0.25) +
                       (Reviewer_Score * 0.15) +
                       (Tester_Score * 0.15) +
                       (Deployer_Score * 0.05) +
                       (Writer_Score * 0.05)
```

### Score Thresholds
- **9.5-10.0**: Exceptional (Ready for production)
- **9.0-9.4**: Excellent (Minor improvements needed)
- **8.5-8.9**: Good (Moderate improvements needed)
- **8.0-8.4**: Acceptable (Significant improvements needed)
- **< 8.0**: Not acceptable (Major rework required)

## Continuous Improvement

### Quality Metrics Tracking
- **Agent Performance**: Success rates, time to completion
- **Quality Trends**: Score improvements over time
- **Feedback Effectiveness**: Time from issue to resolution
- **Gate Efficiency**: False positive/negative rates

### Optimization Strategies
1. **Agent Training**: Improve agent performance based on metrics
2. **Process Refinement**: Optimize workflow based on feedback loops
3. **Tool Enhancement**: Better tools for quality measurement
4. **Knowledge Base**: Capture and share best practices
