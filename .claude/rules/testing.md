# Testing Standards

> Capture expectations for unit, integration, and regression coverage. Expand with frameworks, naming patterns, and fixtures.

## General Guidance

- Mirror `src/` structure inside `test/unit/` and use `test/integration/` for cross-module scenarios.
- Keep tests deterministic; clean up side effects after each run.
- Reference this document when scoping new test plans and mention notable deviations in `handoff.md`.
